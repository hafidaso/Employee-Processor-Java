# Employee Data Processor

This Java project demonstrates the use of the `Function` interface and Java Streams to process a dataset of employees from a CSV file. It performs various operations such as:

- Reading employee data from a CSV file.
- Concatenating employee names and departments using a `Function`.
- Generating collections with Streams.
- Calculating average salaries.
- Filtering employees based on age.
- Demonstrating lazy evaluation and short-circuiting behavior.
- Grouping employees and finding the highest salaries in each department.
- Utilizing parallel streams for performance optimization.
